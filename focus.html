<p>As <a href="https://impartculture.com" target="_blank">Impart</a> Founder & CEO, I recruited a stellar technical team, 
launched multiple web applications with paying customers, 
and ran a profitable business in our first full year. How?</p>
<p><b>Focus. A focus on 2 goals at a time.</b></p> 
<p>A startup's freedom to pursue anything is a double-edged sword.
I see many startups fail because they pursue too much all at once. 
Successful startups wholly focus on great execution of a few top priorities. 
One of my favorite examples is Netflix. See CEO Reed Hasting's <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/78-Summary_ofFreedom_ResponsibilityAs_We_Grow">
Culture deck (slides 40 to 79)</a>.
</p>
<p>To be clear, many of my focused pursuits failed. 
But I failed fast, failed with certainty, and quickly moved on towards success. 
Remember, <a href="http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1109411/shark-tank-season-7-episode-14" target="_blank">
Ideas are cheap. Execution is everything.</a>
</p>
<p>Why focus on 2 not 1? If you're really in it, you're probably obsessing over your goal like your own baby.
Often times you need to step away to see the best solution. 
The other goal gives you that break, and vice versa.</p>
<!--Yes, your first idea probably won't work. 
But at least you fail fast, fail with certainty, and quickly move onto the next test.-->
