<p>Most recently, I was Founder & CEO of Impart.</p> 
<p>Working with little direction and high ambiguity, introspection was invaluable to finding clarity and making decisions.
Specifically, I would articulate my thoughts in writing and often share these with trusted teammates, advisers, and friends.</p>
<p>Logic and emotions are both part of decision-making and essential to daring greatly.
They can be powerful tools in entrepreneurship, where there are no right answers.
Taking time to communicate your thoughts can provide conviction down the road, 
when others - and future you - question you (par for the course).</p>
<p>Plus introspection and communication are free resources. Entrepreneurs like free!</p>
