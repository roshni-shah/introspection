<h2>Time to Introspect</h2>
<p>Most recently, I was Founder & CEO of <a href="https://impartculture.com" target="_blank">Impart</a>.</p> 
<p>Working with little direction and high ambiguity, I found introspection invaluable to finding clarity and making decisions.
Specifically, I would articulate my thoughts in writing and often share these with trusted teammates, advisers, and friends.</p>
<h5>in&#8901tro&#8901spec&#8901tion: the examination or observation of one's own mental and emotional processes.</h5> 
<p>Logic and emotions are both part of decision-making and essential to daring greatly.
They can be powerful tools in entrepreneurship, where there are no right answers.
Taking time to communicate your thoughts can provide conviction down the road, 
when others (and future you) question you - par for the course.</p>
<p>Plus introspection and communication are free resources. Entrepreneurs like free!</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>When Impart was approaching its first cliff, I knew I had to 
cast a big vision and rally an amazing team. This would be the difference between falling or flying. 
</p>
<p>Fortunately I had just read VC Fred Wilson's post about <a href="http://avc.com/2017/07/video-of-the-week-purpose-mission-strategy/">
Purpose, Mission, Strategy </a>(I recommend subscribing to his blog). 
He talks about the importance of all 3 and how to connect them in your company.
</p>
<p>Even more relevant was Fred's post on <a href="http://avc.com/2017/06/being-transparent-about-your-long-term-strategy/">
being transparent about long-term strategy.</a> In it, he cites great examples from Tesla and Coinbase Founders. 
Inspired by Elon Musk's <a href="http://avc.com/2017/06/being-transparent-about-your-long-term-strategy/">
"Secret" Master Plan for Tesla</a>, I articulated my vision for Impart:

<h2>Values</h2>
<p>Once I recruited a stellar team, I knew we could build the best 
Impart by leveraging each person's unique perspective. 
This meant trusting individuals and giving them as much autonomy as possible. 
</p>
<p>
To ensure autonomy leads to individual decisions that are best for the company, I emphasized Impart's vision (above)
and values. Looking back, I believe values were more important than vision. 
At a startup, vision is more likely to change over time, while values should only become more ingrained.  
</p>
<p>For best practices, I looked to <a href="https://a16z.com/2012/12/18/programming-your-culture/">
Programming Your Culture</a>, a chapter from <em><a href="./reading.html">The Hard Thing about Hard Things</a></em>. 
Author and entrepreneur Ben Horowitz states, company culture should:<br>
- Distinguish you from competitors<br>
- Ensure that critical operating values persist such as delighting customers or making beautiful products<br>
- Help you identify employees that fit with your mission<br>
</p>
<p>Inspired by the idea that it's as important to <b>know who you are</b> as it is to <b>know who you're not</b>, I articulated Impart's values:
<ul>
<li>Humans over Technology</li>
<li>Relationships over Transactions</li>
<li>Mindfulness over Expedience</li>
<li>Balance over Perfection</li>
</ul>

<h2>Failure (a.k.a. Quitting)</h2>

<p>I firmly believe failure is synonymous with quitting. When you fail, there's probably some torturous way to keep going. 
But you've decided it's not worth it and quit. That's OK. 
While a high amount of stick-with-it-ness is important, quitting often gets an overly bad rep.</p>
<p>If we think of quitting like failure - a form of learning - it becomes a more rational decision. 
Are you optimally balancing learning, opportunity, risk, and opportunity costs? 
Hint: Everyone is different; there's no right answer :)</p>
<p>So now that I've posited quitting is failure...Failure sucks. If you don't feel that sucky feeling for a bit, I don't think you've really failed. 
But it's true - failure is success in the form of learning. 
Once the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model">5 stages of grief</a> pass, 
you reach acceptance and hope.</p>
