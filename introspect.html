<h2>Introspection</h2>
<p>Most recently, I was Founder & CEO of <a href="https://impartculture.com" target="_blank">Impart</a>. 
Working in high ambiguity, I found introspection invaluable to thinking clearly 
and making sound decisions.</p>
<h5>in&#8901tro&#8901spec&#8901tion: the examination or observation of one's own mental and emotional processes.</h5> 
<p>Logic and emotions are always part of decision-making. Both are essential to daring greatly as in 
entrepreneurship, where there are no right answers.</p>
<p>At Impart, I articulated my thoughts in writing and shared them with trusted teammates, advisers, and friends.
Writing out my perspective provided conviction down the road, 
when others (and future me) would question me. 
<p>I like this piece on <a href="http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/why-everyone-should-write/">
Why Everyone Should Write</a> by Collaborative Fund. 
Plus introspection and writing are free resources. Entrepreneurs like free!</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>When Impart was approaching its first cliff, I knew I had to 
cast a big vision and rally an amazing team. This would be the difference between falling or flying. 
</p>
<p>Fortunately I had just read VC Fred Wilson's post about <a href="http://avc.com/2017/07/video-of-the-week-purpose-mission-strategy/">
Purpose, Mission, Strategy.</a> 
He talks about the importance of all 3 and how to connect them in your company.
</p>
<p>Even more relevant was Fred's post on <a href="http://avc.com/2017/06/being-transparent-about-your-long-term-strategy/">
being transparent about long-term strategy.</a> In it, he cites great examples from Tesla and Coinbase Founders. 
Inspired by Elon Musk's <a href="http://avc.com/2017/06/being-transparent-about-your-long-term-strategy/">
"Secret" Master Plan for Tesla</a>, I articulated my vision for Impart:

<h2>Values</h2>
<p>Once I recruited a stellar team, I knew we could build the best 
Impart by leveraging each person's unique perspective. 
This meant trusting individuals and giving them as much autonomy as possible. 
</p>
<p>
To ensure autonomy led individuals to the best decisions for the company, 
I emphasized Impart's vision (above)
and values (below). Looking back, I believe values are more important to get right than vision. 
As a startup learns and grows, their vision will likely change (pivot!),
 while values will become more ingrained (founders inculcate others).  
</p>
<p>For best practices, I looked to <a href="https://a16z.com/2012/12/18/programming-your-culture/">
Programming Your Culture</a>by tech entrepreneur Ben Horowitz. He states company culture should:<br>
- Distinguish you from competitors<br>
- Ensure that critical operating values persist, such as delighting customers or making beautiful products<br>
- Help you identify employees that fit with your mission<br>
</p>
<p>Inspired by the idea that knowing <b>who you are</b> is as important as <b>who you're not</b>, Impart would value:
<ul>
<li>Humans over Technology</li>
<li>Relationships over Transactions</li>
<li>Mindfulness over Expedience</li>
<li>Balance over Perfection</li>
</ul>

<h2>Failure (a.k.a. Quitting)</h2>
<p>I believe failure is synonymous with quitting. 
When you fail, there's probably some torturous way you could have kept going.
But you decide it's not worth it and quit. That's why it feels so bad - quitting is a choice.</p>
<p>Now that I've posited failure is quitting, it's also true - failure is success in the form of learning. 
Fortunately there's enough people posting successory quotes about failure that it's gained respect.
<p>On the other hand, quitting often gets an overly bad rep.
While a high amount of stick-with-it-ness is important, I believe everyone has their limits. 
If we think of quitting like failure - a form of learning - it becomes a more understandable choice. 
Are you optimally balancing growth, opportunity, risk, and opportunity costs? 
Hint: There's no right answer :)</p>
