<p><q>Victorious warriors win first and then go to war,

And they will follow you into the deepest valley.</q></p>

<p><q>Strategic change doesn't just start at the top. It starts with your calendar.</q></p>
<p><q>In Technology, whatever can be done will be done.</q></p>
<p><q>Your career is your business, and you are its CEO.</q></p>
<p><q>If you're wrong, you will die. 
But most companies don't die because they are wrong; most die because they don't commit themselves. 
They fritter away their valuable resources while attempting to make a decision. 
The greatest danger is in standing still.</q></p>

<p><q>Take care of the people, the products, and the profits - IN THAT ORDER.</q></p>
<p><q>Sometimes an organization doesn't need a solution; it just needs clarity.</q></p>
<p><q>Hard things are hard because there are no easy answers or recipes. 
They are hard because your emotions are at odds with your logic. 
They are hard because you don't know the answer and you cannot ask for help without showing weakness.</q></p>
<p><q>Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I ask them how they did it. 
Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. 
The great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. 
They all say, "I didn't quit."</q></p>

<p><q>If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. 
Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution. 
Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. 
Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. 
Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.</q></p>
<p><q>Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. 
Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. 
Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you. 
Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions -  
your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.</q></p>
<p><q>Do not leave your reputation to chance or gossip; 
it is your life's artwork, and you must craft it, hone it, 
and display it with the care of an artist.</q></p>

<p><q>Remember too that your time is your one finite resource, 
and when you say "yes" to one thing you are inevitably saying "no" to another.</q></p>
<p><q>A manager's output = 
The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence.</q></p>
<p><q>This means that even as we try to standardize what we do, 
we should continue to think critically about what we do and the approaches we use.</q></p>

<p><q>Happiness = Number of desires fulfilled / Number of desires entertained. <br><br>
We can increase happiness by either increasing the numerator or decreasing the denominator. <br>
However, there is one caution about working on the numerator only: Fulfilling our desires generally 
causes more desires to spring up. 
Also, as the number of desires increases, the denominator increases, resulting in reduced happiness.<br> 
Thus, the best way of establishing permanent happiness is to reduce the number of desires entertained
by directing our thoughts to a higher ideal of principle.</q></p>
<p><q>When the person is in a happy mood, you can easily get your job done through him - 
but not when he is preoccupied or mentally worried.
The mind is available for remolding when it is in a cheerful, happy mood.</q></p>
<p><q>To make Truth our own, we must apprehend it directly in our experience. 
It is in the seat of meditation that we learn to use the mind to rise beyond the mind - 
and realize the Truth as our innermost Self.</q></p>

<p><q>I need someone. I need to hold somebody close. And I need more than this holding. I need someone to understand how I feel at a time like now. And the understanding must be part of the holding.</q></p>
<p><q>In teaching your child, do not forget that suffering is good too. It makes a person rich in character.</q></p>
<p><q>I hate all those flirty-birty games that women make up. Life's too short. If you ever find a man you love, don't waste time hanging your head and simpering. Go right up to him and say, 'I love you. How about getting married?'</q></p>

<p><q>Flirting with madness was one thing; when madness started flirting back, it was time to call the whole thing off.</q></p>
<p><q>You have to use your failures as stepping stones to success. You have to maintain a fine balance between hope and despair. 
In the end it's all a question of balance.</q></p>

<p><q>The need to call this thing "good" and this thing "bad," this thing "white" and this thing "black," was an impulse that Effia did not understand. In her village, everything was everything. Everything bore the weight of everything else.</q></p>
<p><q>History is Storytelling.</q>
<br><q>We believe the one who has power. He is the one who gets to write the story. So when you study history, you must ask yourself, Whose story am I missing? Whose voice was suppressed so that this voice could come forth? 
Once you have figured that out, you must find that story too. From there you get a clearer, yet still imperfect, picture.</q></p>
<p><q>There should be no room in your life for regret. If in the moment of doing you felt clarity, you felt certainty, then why feel regret later?</q></p>

<p><q>By concentrating on what I was grateful for, I was able to stave off despair.</q></p>
<p><q>I've realized that the world is, in essence, full of banana peels - loaded with things that may unwittingly trip an internal wire in my mind, opening a floodgate of fears without warning.</q></p>
<p><q>Because that's the thing about the exact moment when you get somewhere that has required effort: There's a freeze-frame instant of total fulfillment, when every expectation has been met and the world is perfect.</q></p>
