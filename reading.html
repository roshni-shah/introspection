<p><q>By concentrating on what I was grateful for, I was able to stave off despair.</q></p>
<p><q>I've realized that the world is, in essence, full of banana peels - loaded with things that may unwittingly trip an internal wire in my mind, opening a floodgate of fears without warning.</q></p>
<p><q>Because that's the thing about the exact moment when you get somewhere that has required effort: There's a freeze-frame instant of total fulfillment, when every expectation has been met and the world is perfect.</q></p>

<p><q>I hate all those flirty-birty games that women make up. Life's too short. If you ever find a man you love, don't waste time hanging your head and simpering. Go right up to him and say, 'I love you. How about getting married?'</q></p>
<p><q>I need someone. I need to hold somebody close. And I need more than this holding. I need someone to understand how I feel at a time like now. And the understanding must be part of the holding.</q></p>
<p><q>In teaching your child, do not forget that suffering is good too. It makes a person rich in character.</q></p>

<p><q>The need to call this thing "good" and this thing "bad," this thing "white" and this thing "black," was an impulse that Effia did not understand. In her village, everything was everything. Everything bore the weight of everything else.</q></p>
<p><q>History is Storytelling.</q>
<br><q>We believe the one who has power. He is the one who gets to write the story. So when you study history, you must ask yourself, Whose story am I missing? Whose voice was suppressed so that this voice could come forth? 
Once you have figured that out, you must find that story too. From there you get a clearer, yet still imperfect, picture.</q></p>
<p><q>There should be no room in your life for regret. If in the moment of doing you felt clarity, you felt certainty, then why feel regret later?</q></p>

<p><q>Flirting with madness was one thing; when madness started flirting back, it was time to call the whole thing off.</q></p>
<p><q>You have to use your failures as stepping stones to success. You have to maintain a fine balance between hope and despair. 
In the end it's all a question of balance.</q></p>
<p><q>How much gratitude for a little sherbert...How starved they seemed for ordinary kindness.</q></p>

<p><q>Strategic change doesn't just start at the top. It starts with your calendar.</q></p>
<p><q>In Technology, whatever can be done will be done.</q></p>
<p><q>Your career is your business, and you are its CEO.</q></p>
<p><q>If you're wrong, you will die. 
But most companies don't die because they are wrong; most die because they don't commit themselves. 
They fritter away their valuable resources while attempting to make a decision. 
The greatest danger is in standing still.</q></p>

<p><q>Take care of the people, the products, and the profits - IN THAT ORDER.</q></p>
<p><q>Sometimes an organization doesn't need a solution; it just needs clarity.</q></p>
<p><q>Hard things are hard because there are no easy answers or recipes. 
They are hard because your emotions are at odds with your logic. 
They are hard because you don't know the answer and you cannot ask for help without showing weakness.</q></p>
<p><q>Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I ask them how they did it. 
Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. 
The great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. 
They all say, "I didnâ€™t quit."</q></p>
